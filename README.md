# Solar-Powered-Floating-Waste-Collector
object-detection/raspberrypi/tensorflowlite/opencv/imageprocessing
This project is based on machine learning to perform object detection using TensorFlow Lite and deployed on Raspberry Pi.
The model performs object detection using a camera connected to raspberrypi and controls the motor drviers used as propellers to navigate itself near the floating object and collects it 
with the use of conveyor belt.
For setting up the raspberrypi and installing the necessary files and tools, checkout this video:-
